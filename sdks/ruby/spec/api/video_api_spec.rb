  # unit tests for api_v1_extend_video_post
  # Extend Video
  # ## Extend Video Duration with Seamless Continuation  Add additional frames to extend the duration of generated videos. Creates smooth continuations that seamlessly flow from the original video.  ### How it Works  Select a previously generated video and optionally provide a prompt to guide the extension. The API analyzes the video&#39;s motion and content, then generates additional frames that naturally continue the sequence. Each extension adds 4 seconds.  ### Required Parameters  - &#x60;jobId&#x60; - UUID of the original video generation task      - &#x60;videoNo&#x60; - Video number to extend (0, 1, 2, or 3)      - &#x60;prompt&#x60; - Optional prompt to guide the extension (1-8192 characters)       ### Authentication  Requires a valid API key passed in the &#x60;x-api-key&#x60; header.  ### Response  Returns a task object. The extended video will be sent to your callback URL when complete (typically 3-5 minutes).  ### Use Cases  - Create longer videos from initial 4-second generations      - Extend successful animations for more content      - Build sequential video narratives      - Generate longer social media content      - Create extended motion sequences       ### Tips  - Each extension adds 4 seconds to the video      - Can extend up to 4 times (maximum 20 seconds total: 4+4+4+4+4)      - Prompt helps guide what happens in the extended portion      - Extension quality depends on the source video&#39;s clarity and motion      - Works with both text-generated and image-animated videos

  # unit tests for api_v1_job_job_id_get
  # Get task response
  # ## Retrieve Job Status and Results  Query the status and results of any task using its job ID. Use this to check progress, retrieve completed results, or diagnose failures.  ### How it Works  Provide a job ID from any previous API request. The API returns the current task status, progress information, and results (if completed). Poll this endpoint to track long-running tasks.  ### Required Parameters  - &#x60;job_id&#x60; - UUID of the task (passed in URL path)       ### Authentication  Requires a valid API key passed in the &#x60;x-api-key&#x60; header.  ### Response  Returns complete task information including:  - &#x60;status&#x60; - Current status: pending, staged, processing, failed, or completed      - &#x60;output&#x60; - Generated images/videos (null until completed)      - &#x60;meta&#x60; - Timestamps, usage information, processing details      - &#x60;error&#x60; - Error details if status is \&quot;failed\&quot;      - &#x60;logs&#x60; - Processing logs and progress updates       ### Status Values  - **pending**: Task queued, waiting to start      - **staged**: Task prepared, about to begin processing      - **processing**: Actively generating (includes progress percentage in logs)      - **completed**: Successfully finished, results available in output field      - **failed**: Processing failed, check error field for details       ### Use Cases  - Poll for task completion if not using webhooks      - Retrieve results for tasks completed days/weeks ago      - Debug failed tasks by examining error messages      - Monitor processing progress for long-running jobs      - Retrieve task history and usage information       ### Tips  - Job IDs are permanent - tasks can be retrieved anytime      - Poll every 10-30 seconds for pending tasks (avoid excessive polling)      - Webhook callbacks are more efficient than polling      - Failed tasks include detailed error messages for debugging      - Completed tasks retain all generation parameters in the input field

  # unit tests for api_v1_video_diffusion_post
  # Video Diffusion
  # ## Generate Videos from Text or Animate Images  Create dynamic videos either from text prompts or by animating existing generated images. Supports two modes: prompt-based generation and image-to-video animation.  ### How it Works  **Mode 1 - Text to Video**: Provide a text prompt and the API generates a video based on the description.   **Mode 2 - Image to Video**: Select a previously generated image and optionally add a prompt. The API animates the image, bringing it to life with motion.  Processing takes 3-5 minutes depending on quality settings. Videos are 4 seconds long.  ### Required Parameters  **For Text Mode**:  - &#x60;prompt&#x60; - Video generation prompt (1-8192 characters)      - &#x60;videoType&#x60; - Quality: 0&#x3D;480p (faster), 1&#x3D;720p (higher quality)       **For Image Animation Mode**:  - &#x60;jobId&#x60; - UUID of source image generation task      - &#x60;imageNo&#x60; - Image number to animate (0, 1, 2, or 3)      - &#x60;prompt&#x60; - Optional prompt to guide animation (1-8192 characters)      - &#x60;videoType&#x60; - Quality: 0&#x3D;480p (faster), 1&#x3D;720p (higher quality)       ### Authentication  Requires a valid API key passed in the &#x60;x-api-key&#x60; header.  ### Response  Returns a task object. The generated videos (4 variations) will be sent to your callback URL when complete (typically 3-5 minutes).  ### Use Cases  - Create animated content from text descriptions      - Bring static generated images to life with animation      - Generate video content for social media      - Create motion graphics and animated sequences      - Produce video mockups and previews       ### Tips  - 720p quality takes longer but provides significantly better results      - Image animation mode adds motion to existing images      - 4-second duration is standard - use extend-video to lengthen      - Prompt in image mode guides animation style and movement      - Text mode generates both visual content and motion

  # unit tests for api_v1_video_upscale_post
  # Video Upscale
  # ## Enhance Video Resolution and Quality  Upscale generated videos to higher resolution with AI-powered quality enhancement. Improves clarity, detail, and overall visual quality.  ### How it Works  Select a previously generated video and the API processes each frame to increase resolution and enhance quality while maintaining motion smoothness and temporal consistency.  ### Required Parameters  - &#x60;jobId&#x60; - UUID of the original video generation task      - &#x60;videoNo&#x60; - Video number to upscale (0, 1, 2, or 3)       ### Authentication  Requires a valid API key passed in the &#x60;x-api-key&#x60; header.  ### Response  Returns a task object. The upscaled video will be sent to your callback URL when complete (typically 4-6 minutes).  ### Use Cases  - Prepare videos for high-resolution displays      - Enhance quality of draft-quality generations      - Create production-ready video assets      - Improve detail and clarity for professional use      - Upgrade videos for client presentations       ### Tips  - Significantly increases processing time due to frame-by-frame enhancement      - Best applied after you&#39;ve selected your preferred video variation      - Cannot be reversed - always keep original lower-resolution version      - Quality improvement is substantial for text clarity and fine details      - Consider workflow: generate/extend first, upscale final selection
