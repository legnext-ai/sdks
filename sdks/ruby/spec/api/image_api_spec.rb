  # unit tests for api_v1_blend_post
  # Blend
  # ## Combine Multiple Images into Unified Creation  Seamlessly blend 2-5 images together to create a single unique image that combines elements, styles, and concepts from all source images.  ### How it Works  Upload 2-5 image URLs and specify an aspect ratio. The API analyzes all images and creates a cohesive blend that merges their visual elements, colors, styles, and concepts.  ### Required Parameters  - &#x60;imgUrls&#x60; - Array of 2-5 image URLs to blend      - &#x60;aspect_ratio&#x60; - Output aspect ratio: \&quot;2:3\&quot; (portrait), \&quot;1:1\&quot; (square), or \&quot;3:2\&quot; (landscape)       ### Authentication  Requires a valid API key passed in the &#x60;x-api-key&#x60; header.  ### Response  Returns a task object. The blended images (4 variations) will be sent to your callback URL when complete (typically 60-90 seconds).  ### Use Cases  - Combine style references for unique visual concepts      - Merge product photos with artistic styles      - Create hybrid concepts from multiple references      - Blend textures and patterns for design work      - Mix character designs or architectural styles       ### Tips  - Works best with 2-3 images; more images create more abstract results      - All source images should be publicly accessible URLs      - The blend is conceptual, not a simple overlay      - Consider the aspect ratio based on your intended use      - Experiment with different image composition, color palettes, or subject matter for varied results.

  # unit tests for api_v1_remix_post
  # Remix
  # ## Transform Images with New Prompts  Apply a new text prompt to an existing image, transforming it while maintaining aspects of the original composition. Controllable intensity for subtle or dramatic changes.  ### How it Works  Select an image and provide a new prompt. The API applies the new description to the existing image, creating variations that blend the original structure with the new concept. Intensity mode controls how strongly the new prompt is applied.  ### Required Parameters  - &#x60;jobId&#x60; - UUID of the original image generation task      - &#x60;imageNo&#x60; - Image number to remix (0, 1, 2, or 3)      - &#x60;remixPrompt&#x60; - New prompt to apply to the image (1-8192 characters)      - &#x60;mode&#x60; - Remix intensity: 0&#x3D;Strong (significant transformation), 1&#x3D;Subtle (light transformation)       ### Authentication  Requires a valid API key passed in the &#x60;x-api-key&#x60; header.  ### Response  Returns a task object. The remixed images (4 variations) will be sent to your callback URL when complete (typically 90-120 seconds).  ### Use Cases  - Change the style or mood of an existing image      - Apply different artistic directions to the same composition      - Modify time of day, weather, or season in scenes      - Transform realistic images to artistic styles (or vice versa)      - Iterate on concepts by applying different prompts       ### Tips  - Mode 0 (Strong) makes dramatic changes while keeping some structure      - Mode 1 (Subtle) makes gentle modifications, preserving more of the original      - Remix prompt completely replaces the original prompt      - Great for style transfer and conceptual variations      - Experiment with both modes to find the right balance

  # unit tests for api_v1_reroll_post
  # Reroll
  # ## Re-execute Task with Same Parameters  Regenerate a new set of images using the exact same parameters as a previous task. This is equivalent to running the original request again with identical settings.  ### How it Works  Provide a previous task&#39;s job ID and the API will execute the same generation with the same prompt and parameters, producing 4 completely new variations.  ### Required Parameters  - &#x60;jobId&#x60; - UUID of the task to reroll       ### Authentication  Requires a valid API key passed in the &#x60;x-api-key&#x60; header.  ### Response  Returns a new task object with different &#x60;job_id&#x60;. The rerolled images (4 new variations) will be sent to your callback URL when complete (typically 60-90 seconds).  ### Use Cases  - Try the same prompt again if initial results didn&#39;t meet expectations      - Generate additional variations without retyping prompts      - Explore different random seeds for the same concept      - Create more options from successful prompts       ### Tips  - Reroll uses the exact same parameters as the original task      - Results will be completely different due to different random seeds      - Consider using variation endpoint instead if you want to build on a specific result      - You can reroll any completed task, even from previous sessions
